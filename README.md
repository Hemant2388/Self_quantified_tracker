# Self_quantified_tracker

Developed a self-quantified app using flask, python, html and css that empowers users to add and manage multiple trackers, including sleep and water intake. Users can upload entries, update and delete them, and view their progress through detailed graphs. This project demonstrates my proficiency in creating dynamic, user-friendly applications focused on personal data tracking and visualization.
